What do we need to deliver? 
1)  a report describing the problem, the method and the results you obtained
2)  a code (specify whether you use authors' code or if you implement it yourself)
3) A description of the code and user's guide is mandatory

When ? 
Deadline is January 6th !


What do we have so far? 
1) Main file: satellite_contrast

2) Functions: SVD_DWT  (made by me) 
              Subbands (made by me)
              SVE      (made by me)
              BPDHE    (download from internet)
              
              
What is missing?
1) Something is wrong with the SVD_DWT function. It`s working but the images doesn`t look like the ones from the article
2) I couldn`t understand very well SVE so I think the function is wrong... need to read more about it and fix it. 
3) The gaussian graphs are not very presentable..will try to make them better. 
4) Make the written report and user`s guide   :(
