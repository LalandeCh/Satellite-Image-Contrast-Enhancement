What do we need to deliver? 
1)  a report describing the problem, the method and the results you obtained **link for report: https://www.sharelatex.com/project/585a6f3a69f45ebb466e8ef7
2)  a code (specify whether you use authors' code or if you implement it yourself)
3) A description of the code and user's guide is mandatory

When ? 
Deadline is January 6th !


What do we have so far? 
1) Main file: satellite_contrast

2) Functions: SVD_DWT  (made by me) 
              Subbands (made by me)
              SVE      (made by me)
              BPDHE    (download from internet)
              LHE      (need to be add - Ben)
              The other functions were already provided from Matlab (histeq, adapthisteq)
              
              
What is missing?
1) Something is wrong with the SVD_DWT function. It`s working but the images don`t look like the ones from the article
2) I couldn`t understand very well SVE so I think the function is wrong... need to read more about it and fix it. 
      The function has been re-implemented using the method given in references
3) The gaussian graphs are not very presentable..will try to make them better.
      The Mean and the Standar Deviation have been added in the title of each histogram.
      The graphs aren't the same as the graphs provided in the paper. Should show the results using the same representation ?
4) Make the written report and user`s guide   :(
